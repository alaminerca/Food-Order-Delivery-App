# Food-Order-Delivery-App
The "Food Order Delivery App" will allow users to browse a restaurant's menu, add items to a cart, and place an order. The restaurant admin will have a separate interface to view incoming orders, mark their status (e.g., "preparing," "out for delivery"), and manage the menu.
